| File Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `dream_record_log_labeled.json` | **Main dream record file.** Contains fully processed dream logs, including `dream_type`, `user_id`, `plant preferences`, `light_level`, `avgMoisture`, `mood_tag`, and more. Used by frontend to render visual dream cards. |
| `merged_data_for_frontend.json` | **Merged sensor data.** Combines historical light and soil moisture records into a unified format before labeling. Useful for testing the intermediate state of the pipeline. |
| `light_data_backup.json` | **Raw light sensor readings.** Collected via the deployed FastAPI light API, representing real-world lux values over time. Used as the light-level input for generating `dream_type`. |

> Note: `dream_record_log_labeled.json` is not final.

This file is automatically generated by `export_dream_records.py` and will be updated in future iterations as the pipeline improves.

- Some fields (e.g. `dream_dialogue`, `health_score`) may be placeholders or `null`
- Additional logic (e.g. refined mood tagging, dream rules) will be applied later
- This file should be considered a **work-in-progress output**, not a static dataset

### Design Note â€“ Per-Plant Configuration Support

In the current implementation, **user-level preferences** such as `water_days`, `likes_bright_light`, and `needs_frequent_water` are applied globally to all plants under the same user.

> To enhance personalization and system granularity, this can be extended to support **per-plant configurations**, enabling:
- Tailored `dream_type` generation based on individual plant needs  
- More accurate `health_score` predictions  
- Future UI customization for different plant species or types  

This would require modifying the data structure returned by `get_user_plants(user_id)` and updating the generator script to assign preferences by `plant_id`.
