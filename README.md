# Buddee Backend

**Buddee** is a modular backend system designed to support smart plant care, combining AI image recognition, environmental sensors, gamified interactions, and user-driven feedback.  
This repository consolidates the backend modules I personally developed during the Grow AI project at UAL.

> “Buddee doesn't just monitor your plant – it helps it dream back.”

### Watch Buddee in Action

[![Demo Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sukiiiiiS7/buddee-backend/main/demo-cover.png)](https://github.com/sukiiiiiS7/buddee-backend/blob/main/Buddee-Demo.mp4)

---
## Features

- **Leaf Classification** using ResNet18 and pseudo-labeled Reddit data
- **Light Sensor Module** with ESP32 and local OLED display
- **Smart Watering Predictor** using Random Forest regression
- **Dream Record System** with symbolic environmental feedback
- **Achievement & Lottery Engine** to gamify plant nurturing
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration** for real-time data logging
- **FastAPI Deployment** hosted on Render

---

## System Architecture

> _Three-layer logic: Sensor → Backend → Dream Feedback_

- **Hardware Layer:** ESP32 captures lux/moisture data and displays info on OLED.
- **Backend Layer (FastAPI):**
  - `/leaf_scan`: Image → health classification → care suggestion
  - `/lux`: Sensor POST → database → timestamped storage
  - `/leaf/next_watering`: Combines user location, forecast, plant data to return watering recommendation
  - `/get_achievements`: Returns unlocked achievements
- **Database Layer:** MongoDB Atlas with collections for users, dream logs, health scores, and achievements
- (Optional) **Frontend:** React-based UI display (built by teammates; not included here)

---

## Prediction Models

The Buddee backend uses a trained **Random Forest Regression model** to predict ideal next watering time for plants:

- **Inputs:**
  - Light intensity (lux)
  - Soil moisture
  - Local rainfall forecast (via Open-Meteo API)
  - Plant preference thresholds (pre-defined rules)
  - Historical environment data (stored in MongoDB)

- **Output:**
  - Number of days until next watering (returned by `/leaf/next_watering/{user_id}`)

- **Details:**
  - Implemented in `predict_watering.py`
  - Integrated into FastAPI with logic fallback
  - Chosen for interpretability and lightweight deployment
